# If/ Else conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false



# Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) - Used to compare values



# Logical operators (and, or, not) - Used to combine conditional statements




# Membership Operators (in, not in) - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object




# Identity Operators (is, is not) - Compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:


x=10
y=50

# if x>y:
#     print(f'{x} is great than {y}')
# elif x==y:
#     print(f'{x} is equal {y}')
# else:
#     print(f'{y} is great then {x}')

# if x>2 and x<=10:
#     print('x is greater than 2 and less than 10')

# if not (x==y):
#     print ('x is not equal to y')
